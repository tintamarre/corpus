## Description

In order to simplify and facilitate a methodology for corpus analysis (interviews, focus groups, press articles, etc.), Corpus offers a service that is both simple and efficient, based on the experience in qualitative methodology by ULiÃ¨ge. The methodology proposed by Corpus comprises three essential steps. We distinguish exploration, stripping and analysis.
